  <p><b>Jacob Bernoulli</b>'s father, Nicolaus Bernoulli (1623-1708) inherited the
    spice business in Basel that had been set up by his own father, first in Amsterdam and
    then in Basel. The family, of Belgium origin, were refugees fleeing from persecution by
    the Spanish rulers of the Netherlands. Philip, the King of Spain, had sent the Duke of
    Alba to the Netherlands in 1567 with a large army to punish those opposed to Spanish rule,
    to enforce adherence to Roman Catholicism, and to re-establish Philip's authority. Alba
    set up the Council of Troubles which was a court that condemned over 12000 people but
    most, like the Bernoulli family who were of the Protestant faith, fled the country.</p>
    <p>Nicolaus Bernoulli was an important citizen of Basel, being a member
    of the town council and a magistrate. Jacob Bernoulli's mother also came from an important
    Basel family of bankers and local councillors. Jacob Bernoulli was the brother of <a
    href="johann_bernoulli.html">Johann Bernoulli</a> and the uncle of <a
    href="daniel_bernoulli.html">Daniel Bernoulli</a>. He was compelled to study philosophy
    and theology by his parents, which he greatly resented, and he graduated from the
    University of Basel with a master's degree in philosophy in 1671 and a licentiate in
    theology in 1676.</p>

    <p>During the time that Jacob Bernoulli was taking his university
    degrees he was studying mathematics and astronomy against the wishes of his parents. It is
    worth remarking that this was a typical pattern for many of the Bernoulli family who made
    a study of mathematics despite pressure to make a career in other areas. However Jacob
    Bernoulli was the first to go down this road so for him it was rather different in that
    there was no tradition of mathematics in the family before Jacob Bernoulli. Later members
    of the family must have been much influenced by the tradition of studying mathematics and
    mathematical physics.</p>
    <p>In 1676, after taking his theology degree, Bernoulli moved to Geneva
    where he worked as a tutor. He then travelled to France spending two years studying with
    the followers of <a href="descartes.html">Descartes</a> who were led at this time by
    Malebranche. In 1681 Bernoulli travelled to the Netherlands where he met many
    mathematicians including Hudde. Continuing his studies with the leading mathematicians and
    scientists of Europe he went to England where, among others, he met Boyle and Hooke. At
    this time he was deeply interested in astronomy and produced a work giving an incorrect
    theory of comets. As a result of his travels, Bernoulli began a correspondence with many
    mathematicians which he carried on over many years.</p>
    <p>Jacob Bernoulli returned to Switzerland and taught mechanics at the
    University in Basel from 1683, giving a series of important lectures on the mechanics of
    solids and liquids. Since his degree was in theology it would have been natural for him to
    turn to the Church, but although he was offered an appointment in the Church he turned it
    down. Bernoulli's real love was for mathematics and theoretical physics and it was in
    these topics that he taught and researched. During this period he studied the leading
    mathematical works of his time including Descartes's <i>Géométrie</i> and van Schooten's
    additional material in the Latin edition. Jacob Bernoulli also studied the work of Wallis
    and Barrow and through these he became interested in infinitesimal geometry. Jacob began
    publishing in the journal <i>Acta Eruditorum</i> which was established in Leipzig in 1682.</p>
    <p>In 1684 Jacob Bernoulli married Judith Stupanus. They were to have
    two children, a son who was given his grandfather's name of Nicolaus and a daughter. These
    children, unlike many members of the Bernoulli family, did not go on to become
    mathematicians or physicists.</p>
    <p>One of the most significant events concerning the mathematical
    studies of Jacob Bernoulli occurred when his younger brother,<a
    href="johann_bernoulli.html"> Johann Bernoulli</a>, began to work on mathematical topics.
    Johann Bernoulli was told by his father to study medicine but while he was studying that
    topic he asked his brother Jacob Bernoulli to teach him mathematics. Jacob Bernoulli was
    appointed professor of mathematics in Basel in 1687 and the two brothers began to study
    the calculus as presented by <a href="leibniz.html">Leibniz</a> in his 1684 paper on the
    differential calculus in <i>Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis, itemque Tangentibus...</i>
    published in <i>Acta Eruditorum.</i> They also studied the publications of von
    Tschirnhaus. It must be understood that Leibniz's publications on the calculus were very
    obscure to mathematicians of that time and the Bernoullis were the first to try to
    understand and apply Leibniz's theories.</p>
    <p>Although Jacob and <a href="johann_bernoulli.html">Johann Bernoulli</a>
    both worked on similar problems their relationship was soon to change from one of
    collaborators to one of rivals. Johann Bernoulli's boasts were the first cause of Jacob's
    attacks on him and Jacob wrote that Johann was his pupil whose only achievements were to
    repeat what his teacher had taught him. Of course this was a grossly unfair statement.
    Jacob Bernoulli continued to attack his brother in print in a disgraceful and unnecessary
    fashion, particularly after 1697. However he did not reserve public criticism for his
    brother. He was critical of the university authorities at Basel and again he was very
    public in making critical statements that, as one would expect, left him in a difficult
    situation at the university. Jacob probably felt that Johann was the more powerful
    mathematician of the two and, this hurt since Jacob's nature meant that he always had to
    feel that he was winning praise from all sides. Hofmann writes in [1]:-</p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Sensitivity, irritability, a mutual passion for criticism, and an
      exaggerated need for recognition alienated the brothers, of whom Jacob had the slower but
      deeper intellect.</i>
    </blockquote>
    As suggested by this quote the brothers were equally at fault in
    their quarrel. <a href="johann_bernoulli.html">Johann Bernoulli</a> would have liked the
    chair of mathematics at Basel which Jacob held and he certainly resented having to move to
    Holland in 1695. This was another factor in the complete breakdown of relations in 1697.
    <p>Of course the dispute between the brothers over who could obtain the
    greatest recognition was a particularly stupid one in the sense that both made
    contributions to mathematics of the very greatest importance. Whether the rivalry spurred
    them on to greater things or whether they might have achieved more had they continued
    their initial collaboration, it is impossible to say. We shall now examine some of the
    major contributions made by Jacob Bernoulli at an important stage in the development of
    mathematics following <a href="leibniz.html">Leibniz</a>'s work on the calculus.</p>
    <p>Jacob Bernoulli's first important contributions were a pamphlet on
    the parallels of logic and algebra published in 1685, work on probability in 1685 and
    geometry in 1687. His geometry result gave a construction to divide any triangle into four
    equal parts with two perpendicular lines.</p>
    <p>By 1689 he had published important work on infinite series and
    published his law of large numbers in probability theory. The interpretation of
    probability as relative-frequency says that if an experiment is repeated a large number of
    times then the relative frequency with which an event occurs equals the probability of the
    event. The law of large numbers is a mathematical interpretation of this result. Jacob
    Bernoulli published five treatises on infinite series between 1682 and 1704. The first two
    of these contained many results, such as fundamental result that &sum;(1/n) diverges, which
    Bernoulli believed were new but they had actually been proved by Mengoli 40 years earlier.
    Bernoulli could not find a closed form for &sum;(1/n<sup><small>2</small></sup>) but he did show that it converged to a
    finite limit less than 2. <a href="euler.html">Euler</a> was the first to find the sum of
    this series in 1737. Bernoulli also studied the exponential series which came out of
    examining compound interest.</p>
    <p>In May 1690 in a paper published in <i>Acta Eruditorum,</i> Jacob
    Bernoulli showed that the problem of determining the isochrone is equivalent to solving a
    first-order nonlinear differential equation. The isochrone, or curve of constant descent,
    is the curve along which a particle will descend under gravity from any point to the
    bottom in exactly the same time, no matter what the starting point. It had been studied by
    Huygens in 1687 and<a href="leibniz.html"> Leibniz</a> in 1689. After finding the
    differential equation, Bernoulli then solved it by what we now call separation of
    variables. Jacob Bernoulli's paper of 1690 is important for the history of calculus, since
    the term integral appears for the first time with its integration meaning. In 1696
    Bernoulli solved the equation, now called &quot;the Bernoulli equation&quot;,</p>
    <p>y' = p(x)y + q(x)y<sup><small>n</small></sup></p>
    <p>and Hofmann describes this part of his work as:-</p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>... proof of Bernoulli's careful and critical work on older as
      well as on contemporary contributions to infinitesimal mathematics and of his perseverance
      and analytical ability in dealing with special pertinent problems, even those of a
      mechanical-dynamic nature.</i>
    </blockquote>
    Jacob Bernoulli also discovered a general method to determine
    evolutes of a curve as the envelope of its circles of curvature. He also investigated
    caustic curves and in particular he studied these associated curves of the parabola, the
    logarithmic spiral and epicycloids around 1692. The lemniscate of Bernoulli was first
    conceived by Jacob Bernoulli in 1694. In 1695 he investigated the drawbridge problem which
    seeks the curve required so that a weight sliding along the cable always keeps the
    drawbridge balanced.
    <p>Jacob Bernoulli's most original work was <i>Ars Conjectandi</i>
    published in Basel in 1713, eight years after his death. The work was incomplete at the
    time of his death but it is still a work of the greatest significance in the theory of
    probability. In the book Bernoulli reviewed work of others on probability, in particular
    work by van Schooten, <a href="leibniz.html">Leibniz</a>, and Prestet. The Bernoulli
    numbers appear in the book in a discussion of the exponential series. Many examples are
    given on how much one would expect to win playing various game of chance. There are
    interesting thoughts what probability really is [1]:-</p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>... probability as a measurable degree of certainty; necessity
      and chance; moral versus mathematical expectation; a priori an a posteriori probability;
      expectation of winning when players are divided according to dexterity; regard of all
      available arguments, their valuation, and their calculable evaluation; law of large
      numbers ...</i>
    </blockquote>
      In [1] Hofmann sums up Jacob Bernoulli's contributions as follows:-
    <blockquote>
      <i>Bernoulli greatly advanced algebra, the infinitesimal calculus,
      the calculus of variations, mechanics, the theory of series, and the theory of
      probability. He was self-willed, obstinate, aggressive, vindictive, beset by feelings of
      inferiority, and yet firmly convinced of his own abilities. With these characteristics, he
      necessarily had to collide with his similarly disposed brother. He nevertheless exerted
      the most lasting influence on the latter.</i>
      <br><i>Bernoulli was one of the most significant promoters of the formal
      methods of higher analysis. Astuteness and elegance are seldom found in his method of
      presentation and expression, but there is a maximum of integrity.</i>
    </blockquote>
    Jacob Bernoulli continued to hold the chair of mathematics at Basel
    until his death in 1705 when the chair was filled by his brother Johann. Jacob had always
    found the properties of the logarithmic spiral to be almost magical and he had requested
    that it be carved on his tombstone with the Latin inscription &quot;Eadem Mutata
    Resurgo&quot; meaning &quot;I shall arise the same though changed&quot;.
