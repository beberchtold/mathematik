<h4>Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem</h4>

<p>This theorem is one of the most important proven in this century,
ranking with Einstein's Theory of Relativity and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
However, very few people know about it. The excerpts below should, I hope, help explain it.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>In 1931, the Czech-born mathematician Kurt Gödel demonstrated that
  within any given branch of mathematics, there would always be some propositions that
  couldn't be proven either true or false using the rules and axioms ... of that
  mathematical branch itself. You might be able to prove every conceivable statement about
  numbers within a system by going <em>outside</em> the system in order to come up with new
  rules an axioms, but by doing so you'll only create a larger system with its own
  unprovable statements. The implication is that <em>all</em> logical system of any
  complexity are, by definition, incomplete; each of them contains, at any given time, more
  true statements than it can possibly prove according to its own defining set of rules.</p>
  <p>Gödel's Theorem has been used to argue that a computer can never be
  as smart as a human being because the extent of its knowledge is limited by a fixed set of
  axioms, whereas people can discover unexpected truths ... It plays a part in modern
  linguistic theories, which emphasize the power of language to come up with new ways to
  express ideas. And it has been taken to imply that you'll never entirely understand
  yourself, since your mind, like any other closed system, can only be sure of what it knows
  about itself by relying on what it knows about itself. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jones and Wilson, <cite>An Incomplete Education</cite> </p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>Gödel showed that within a rigidly logical system such as Russell
  and Whitehead had developed for arithmetic, propositions can be formulated that are
  undecidable or undemonstrable within the axioms of the system. That is, within the system,
  there exist certain clear-cut statements that can neither be proved or disproved. Hence
  one cannot, using the usual methods, be certain that the axioms of arithmetic will not
  lead to contradictions ... It appears to foredoom hope of mathematical certitude through
  use of the obvious methods. Perhaps doomed also, as a result, is the ideal of science - to
  devise a set of axioms from which all phenomena of the external world can be deduced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boyer, <cite>History of Mathematics</cite> </p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>He proved it impossible to establish the internal logical
  consistency of a very large class of deductive systems - elementary arithmetic, for
  example - unless one adopts principles of reasoning so complex that their internal
  consistency is as open to doubt as that of the systems themselves ... Second main
  conclusion is ... Gödel showed that <i>Principia</i>, or any other system within which
  arithmetic can be developed, is <em>essentially incomplete</em>. In other words, given <em>any</em>
  consistent set of arithmetical axioms, there are true mathematical statements that cannot
  be derived from the set... Even if the axioms of arithmetic are augmented by an indefinite
  number of other true ones, there will always be further mathematical truths that are not
  formally derivable from the augmented set. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nagel and Newman, <cite>Gödel's Proof</cite></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>The proof of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem is so simple, and so
  sneaky, that it is almost embarassing to relate. His basic procedure is as follows:
  <ol>
    <li>Someone introduces Gödel to a UTM, a machine that is supposed to be
      a Universal Truth Machine, capable of correctly answering any question at all. </li>
    <li>Gödel asks for the program and the circuit design of the UTM. The
      program may be complicated, but it can only be finitely long. Call the program P(UTM) for
      Program of the Universal Truth Machine.</li>
    <li>Smiling a little, Gödel writes out the following sentence: &quot;The
      machine constructed on the basis of the program P(UTM) will never say that this sentence
      is true.&quot; Call this sentence G for Gödel. <em>Note that G is equivalent to:
      &quot;UTM will never say G is true.&quot;</em> </li>
    <li>Now Gödel laughs his high laugh and asks UTM whether G is true or not.</li>
    <li>If UTM says G is true, then &quot;UTM will never say G is true&quot;
      is false. If &quot;UTM will never say G is true&quot; is false, then G is false (since G =
      &quot;UTM will never say G is true&quot;). So if UTM says G is true, then G is in fact
      false, and UTM has made a false statement. So UTM will never say that G is true, since UTM
      makes only true statements.</li>
    <li>We have established that UTM will never say G is true. So &quot;UTM
      will never say G is true&quot; is in fact a true statement. So G is true (since G =
      &quot;UTM will never say G is true&quot;).</li>
    <li>&quot;I know a truth that UTM can never utter,&quot; Gödel says.
      &quot;I know that G is true. UTM is not truly universal.&quot; </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Think about it - it grows on you ... </p>
  <p>With his great mathematical and logical genius, Gödel was able to
  find a way (for any given P(UTM)) actually to write down a complicated polynomial equation
  that has a solution if and only if G is true. So G is not at all some vague or
  non-mathematical sentence. <em>G is a specific mathematical problem that we know the
  answer to, even though UTM does not!</em> So UTM does not, and cannot, embody a best and
  final theory of mathematics ... </p>
  <p>Although this theorem can be stated and proved in a rigorously
  mathematical way, what it seems to say is that <em>rational thought can never penetrate to
  the final ultimate truth</em> ... But, paradoxically, to understand Gödel's proof is to
  find a sort of liberation. For many logic students, the final breakthrough to full
  understanding of the Incompleteness Theorem is practically a conversion experience. This
  is partly a by-product of the potent mystique Gödel's name carries. But, more profoundly,
  to understand the essentially labyrinthine nature of <em>the castle</em> is, somehow, to
  be free of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rucker, <cite>Infinity and the Mind</cite></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include undecidable propositions ... </p>
  <p>Gödel showed that provability is a weaker notion than truth, no matter what axiom system is involved ... </p>
  <p>How can you figure out if you are sane? ... Once you begin to
  question your own sanity, you get trapped in an ever-tighter vortex of self-fulfilling
  prophecies, though the process is by no means inevitable. Everyone knows that the insane
  interpret the world via their own peculiarly consistent logic; how can you tell if your
  own logic is &quot;peculiar' or not, given that you have only your own logic to judge
  itself? I don't see any answer. I am reminded of Gödel's second theorem, which implies
  that the only versions of formal number theory which assert their own consistency are
  inconsistent. </p>
  <p>The other metaphorical analogue to Gödel's Theorem which I find
  provocative suggests that ultimately, we cannot understand our own mind/brains ... Just as
  we cannot see our faces with our own eyes, is it not inconceivable to expect that we
  cannot mirror our complete mental structures in the symbols which carry them out? All the
  limitative theorems of mathematics and the theory of computation suggest that once the
  ability to represent your own structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the
  kiss of death: it guarantees that you can never represent yourself totally.</p>
