<p>French theorist who developed the mechanical philosophy, which was highly influential until superseded by
 <a href="newton.html">Newton's</a> methodology. He believed that matter had no real qualities, but was simply the
 &quot;brute stuff'' which occupied space. He divided reality into the res cognitas (consciousness, mind) and res
 extensa (matter, extension). His mechanical philosophy led him to believe that the universe is a plenum in which no
 vacuum can exist. In <i>Traité de l'homme (Treatise on Man)</i> (1664) and <i>Passions de l'âme (Passions of the Soul)
 </i> (1649), he expounded the view that an animal was an automaton lacking both sensation and self-awareness, and that
 only man was endowed with a soul. He generalized Harvey's mechanical interpretation of circulation, believing that the
 heart is an automatic mechanical pump.</p>
<p>He also believed that colors were caused by the rotation of &quot;spheres'' of light, using the tennis ball as a model
 of a spinning sphere. He, unlike <a href="newton.html">Newton</a> believed that white light was the pristine form.
 Descartes gave the first formulation of what is now known as Snell's Law of refraction. Descartes believed that God
 created the universe as a perfect clockwork mechanism of vortical motion that functioned deterministically thereafter
 without intervention.</p>

<p>Descartes said that the fundamental force of motion was <b>Mass times Velocity</b> (today known as
 <b>Momentum</b>), not the quantity which<a href="leibniz.html"> Leibniz</a> called vis viva. Although this formulation
 was correct, Leibniz nonetheless maintained that the measure of a body's &quot;force'' was not given simply by the
 product of Mass times Velocity, but instead by the product of <b>Mass times Velocity squared</b> (which is proportional
 to what is now called <b>Kinetic Energy</b> ). Since the conservation of quantity of motion had become one of the
 pillars of Cartesian natural philosophy, Leibniz's suggestion that the fundamental quantity of motion was different
 from the one Descartes had proposed was rejected out of hand by all good Cartesians. A great controversy ensued between
 the German school of physical thought, which naturally supported <a href="leibniz.html">Leibniz</a>, and the
 French and English schools, whose Cartesians and Newtonians opposed him.</p>
<p>Descartes believed that a system of knowledge should start from first principles and proceed mathematically to a
 series of deductions, reducing physics to mathematics. In <b><i>Discours de la Méthode</i> (1637)</b>, he advocated the
 systematic doubting of knowledge, believing as Plato that sense perception and reason deceive us and that man cannot
 have real knowledge of nature. The only thing that he believed he could be certain of was that he was doubting, leading
 to his famous phrase &quot;<b>Cogito ergo sum</b>,'' (I think, therefore I am). From this one phrase, he derived the
 rest of philosophy, including the existence of God. He also was the first to make a <b>Graph</b> , allowing a
 geometric interpretation of a mathematical <b>Function</b>&nbsp; and giving his name to <b>Cartesian Coordinates</b>.</p>
